However, the blue crystals are there to remind us of the scarce and purely natural resources we still have left.\"</i>"

[E]lien consumes all data from the chaotic digital space, the resources, language, symbols, images, and later forms its specia presence as the data accumulate. For the collaboration with Wasted Wild, I see it as an extension of the [E]lien world.

I thought this was just a typical collaboration. After I acknowledged the NFT community that Capsule Vault team is trying to establish, all of a sudden I felt like I am down in the rabbit hole. That's when I came up with this human in disguise who is trying to survive in the Wasted Wild world. I find this character shares a lot of similarities with myself, a traditional creator entering the NFT world.”</i><br /><br />Sic is working on the collaboration with artist Raimochi from Rug Pull Frens collection.

Rai achieves to capture the tinge of lost, stumbles in life and wounds that are hidden away, manifesting these senses into characteristic sceneries popping with bold colours.<br /><br /><strong>Raimochi’s Special Edition 1/1 Crab</strong><br /><i>“This work is inspired by the mutual syllable of the Mandarin idiom 花開花謝(Huā kāi huā xiè) and crab 螃蟹(Páng xiè). The idiom means the flowers blossom yet wither; they bloom for the briefly splendid life. Nature illustrates both vulnerability and strength. Although the crab has a hard shell, it is covered in bandaids. Despite that life finds a way, it requires protection to keep going. Flowers wither after blossoming, and the cycle of life begins again. For a better future, let us treat each other with more affection.”</i>"
