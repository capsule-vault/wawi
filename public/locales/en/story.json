  "description": "Capsule Vault proudly presents Wasted Wild, a collection of 4200 imaginary beings thriving in the post-human age. Preceded by <aAbar>Absurd Arboretum</aAbar>, the project inherits and embodies the core ethos of becoming an integral part of our ecology by planting trees with initial primary sales and with each secondary sale continuously.<br /><br />These procedurally generated life forms are not only digital, non-fungible tokens living on the Ethereum blockchain, stored as ERC-721 tokens and materialized as high-resolution images crafted with sophisticated techniques, but also haunting caricatures of their endangered ancestors living in the physical world with us today. These evolved descendants remind humans of the looming tragedy if we continue to ignore the alert Nature has been signaling us.<br /><br />The mutated Wildlings in Wasted Wild are both victims and deities in a quasi-dystopian world that has become increasingly intolerable for pure biological organisms that we were familiar with. They have adapted to live in undesirable conditions filled with waste, the majority of which has been produced by human activities and post-industrial civilizations; a lot of these creatures have even developed varying levels of cyborg-like biomechatronic features to augment their daily lives."
